      <p>
        Welcome to my world! I'm <strong>Pieter Deane</strong>, a <strong>self-taught developer</strong> deeply passionate about crafting websites and applications. <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faLaptopCode} /> Without a formal computer science background, I've embarked on a journey of relentless learning, immersing myself in diverse programming languages and tools.
      </p>

      <p>
        My adventure in the world of development sparked from a simple curiosity about how websites come to life. I began with HTML and CSS, and soon ventured into the realms of JavaScript and frameworks like React. <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faHandshake} /> While my path has been challenging, it's been an incredible learning experience, and I'm eagerly anticipating the future's uncharted territory. I take immense pride in my progress and the projects I've brought to life, and I'm excited to witness the milestones I'll reach in the coming years. <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faFileAlt} />
      </p>

      <p>
        My portfolio serves as a testament to my skills, showcasing my ability to create not only visually appealing but also highly functional websites and applications. <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faLaptopCode} /> I'm enthusiastic about collaborating with fellow developers, continuously learning from experienced peers, and sharing my knowledge with newcomers to the field. <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faHandshake} />
