      <p>
        Welcome to my Portfolio. My name is <strong>Pieter Deane</strong> and I am a <strong>self-taught developer</strong> with a passion for building websites and applications.Although i don't have a formal	computer science,
        i have spent countless hours learning and practicing various programming languages and tools.

        </p>
        <p>My  Journey into the world of development started with a simple curiosity about how websites are built.
        from there , I delved into HTML and CSS, and  eventually Javascript and frameworks like React. While my journey hasn't been easy, I have learned a lot along the way and I am excited to see where it takes me next.i am proud of the progress i've made and the projects I've built so far, and I can't wait to see what I can accomplish in the future.	
        </p>
        <p>
          Though my portfolio, i hope to showcase my skills and demonstrate my ability to create beautiful,
          and functional websites and applications. I am eager to collaborate with others  and continue learning from experienced developers,while also sharing my own knowledge with those who are just starting out.
        </p>
